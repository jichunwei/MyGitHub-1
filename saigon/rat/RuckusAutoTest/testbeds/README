Implementations of different types of testbeds go in here -- one class implementation per file.

Note that the name of the testbed class must match the name of the file for ease of runtime-reference.

Nothing other than testbed classes should go in this directory since database initialization code introspects
this module and assumes everything under here is a TestbedType that should be added to the database!
